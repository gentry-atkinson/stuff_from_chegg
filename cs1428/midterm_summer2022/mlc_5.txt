Write a short code snippet (not a full program) which will prompt the user to enter a floating point number. 
Use a  while loop which will repeatedly print the number, dividing it by 3 each time. Your loop should run until the 
number is less than 4. Your code should only take input from the user once, and should never print a number less than 4. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declaring a floating point number
    float x;
    
    // Prompt message for the user to input number
    cout << "Type a floating point number: ";
    
    // Get user input from the keyboard
    cin >> x; 
    
    // while loop execution
    while( x >= 1 ) {
        // Printing the value of x
        cout << "value of x: " << x << endl;
        // Dividing x by 2 each time the loop runs
        x = x/2;
    }
   
    return 0;
}
